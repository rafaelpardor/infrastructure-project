# Infrastructure Project

Infrastructure engineer project

## Tools

Tools I want to use

* Golang
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Redis
* Elasticsearch
* RabbitMQ
* Postgres/MySql
* Jenkins

## Why

Why not?

## Purpose

I want to create a high reliable system, at the moment, I don't know
what will do, (exactly), but taking into account the tools I want to use
it will be some kind of ETL system. And will display the gathered
information.

Now, I don't want to implement everything at the first try, I will have
troubles doing the project, but from somewhere we need to learn.
